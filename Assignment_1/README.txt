Assignment 1: Camera geometric calibration 
 - Developers: José Luis Cano-Manuel Claver and Ana San Román Gaitero 
 - Subject: Computer Vision 

The code is divided into two files: a .py where the functions are described and a .pynb where
each of the runs can be done changing the path of a directory where the images of each run are.



Off-line: 
	Calibrate geometrically your camera using the training images, choosing the correspoding
        run (Run 1, Run 2, and Run 3) of interest. For the manual selection, press the points on the image which correspond to the 4 corners
	and press 'q' to show the obtained interpolation. You can use both right or left click.


On-line:
	Draw the x, y, z axis and a cube on your image on real life using your webcam. 
	Press 'q' to exit the video.
